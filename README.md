## Setup and Deployment

To set up AppliFocus locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

1. **Git** - Ensure you have Git installed on your machine.
2. **Python** - Ensure Python is installed.
3. **Virtual Environment (venv)** - Recommended for managing dependencies in isolation.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder-name>
   ```

3. **Set up a Virtual Environment**  
   If there's an existing `venv`, delete it first.
   ```bash
   rm -rf venv  # For Linux/macOS
   rd /s /q venv  # For Windows
   python -m venv venv  # Create a new virtual environment
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Navigate to the Django Project Root Directory**  
   Move into the main Django application directory:
   ```bash
   cd OpenColabAI
   ```

7. **Run Migrations**  
   Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. **Create a Superuser (for admin access)**  
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

9. **Collect Static Files**  
   Prepare static files for production:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

10. **Start the Django Development Server**  
    Run the server locally:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access AppliFocus. You can log in with your superuser credentials to access the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.
